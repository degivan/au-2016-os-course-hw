2.src/initialize_pic.c - initializes interrupt controller.
3.src/initialize_pit.c - initializes interrupt timer.
4.src/initialize_serial.c - initializes uart. Contains also some functions to write in the port.
5.src/inner.c - inner function-handler for timer interrupt. Is called by outer-function.
6.src/main.c - the main file that calls all initializations and set the idtr.
7.src/other_inner.c - inner function-handler for another interrupts. Is called by other_outer-function.
8.src/other_outer.S - function-handler for another interrupts.
9.src/outer.S - function-handler for timer interrupt.
